# Why Graphs?

![:vspace 80]()

--

.font170[
Convert data that our working memory cannot retain into **direct visual stimuli**
that do not require "reading"
]

--

.font140[
- We have a poor working memory (~ 7 elements)...
]

--

.font140[
- but our eyes have **superpowers**!
  - ~ 30% of our brain is dedicated to visual processing
  - We can process ~ 100 Mbps
]

# Why Graphs?

![:vspace 150]()

.font170[
Visual reasoning is way **faster** and **more reliable** than mental reasoning

# Why Graphs?

![:vspace 100]()

.font170[
Visualization allows us to summarize information while retaining details...

... as such, it can reveal information that summary statistics may hide

# Why Graphs?

.font170[
Visualization can be faster than your eyes can move!

.font140[

.font150[
- Better? Faster, more accurately, increased confidence, more insights, better decisions, etc.

# Principles of Graphical Excellence

.footnote[Tufte, E. R. (2018) _**The visual display of quantitative information**_. Graphics Press.]

![:vspace 20]()

--

- Graphical excellence is the **well-designed presentation** of **interesting
  data**—a matter of _substance_, of _statistics_, and of _design_.

--

- Graphical excellence consists of **complex ideas** communicated
  with **clarity, precision, and efficiency**.

--

- Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the **greatest number
  of ideas** in the **shortest time** with the **least ink** in the **smallest space**.

--

- Graphical excellence is nearly always **multivariate**.

--

- And graphical excellence requires telling the **truth** about the data.
